## What is Microbiology

Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms, those being unicellular, multicellular, or acellular. Microbiology includes virology, mycology, parasitology, protistology and bacteriology.

Since many of these disciplines are used in biotechnology and most modern biological laboratories, microbiology techniques are used around the world from the diagnosis of a pathogen in a medical laboratory to the construction of synthetic organisms.
