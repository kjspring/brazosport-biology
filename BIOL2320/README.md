## Synopsis

This repository contains the information used to teach Brazosport College students techniques in microbiology. This includes a laboratory manual, project instructions, lab protocols, 

## Motivation

Most microbiology laboratory books have classical methods such as staining and differential tests. Most microbiology laboratories still have an project of identifying an unknown bacteria using these differential tests. This is in contrast to modern microbiology diagnostic techniques to identify species and the use of microbiology in biotechnology and synthetic biology.

This repository aims to stay up to date in the latest uses of microbiology in the laboratory setting. This includes using microbiology for medical, biotechnology, bioengineering, and studies in ecology and evolution.
