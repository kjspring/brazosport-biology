# Philosophy of Teaching Using an Active and Natural Learning Approach in the Biological Sciences

# Author: Kevin Spring

## Purpose
The purpose of this statement is to identify the active learning teaching philosophy of biology courses.

## I. What is personal education & active learning & natural learning & and science based education
- All learning requires some kind of experience
	- some experiences are more lasting than others
	- experiences need to acheive the objectives and develop transferable skill sets
- active learning is student's active participation in their education and the application of their learning and skills.
	- problem based learning
		- problem drives the learning
- Guidelines:
	- Professor is 'student-oriented'
	- STudents participate in goal setting
	- climate is supportive
	- Activities are problem-centered and student-driven
	- Assessment is continuous and supportive
	- Teaching is 'developmental' rather than 'directed'
	- Failure with effort is not penalized
- The need for active learning in community colleges
